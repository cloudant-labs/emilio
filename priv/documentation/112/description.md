Indentation should not increase by more than two levels

Changes in indentation should be used to indicate the logical
structure of the code. These changes should also follow logical
rules for when they are applied. Since there's never a reason
to have code suddenly indented by more than two levels this is
a first pass sanity check on code structure.
